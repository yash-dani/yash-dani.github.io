  I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

  Recently, I've built projects used by over 250,000 people.

  Previously, I've interned at Shareworks by Morgan Stanley, and a bunch of startups. 

  At Waterloo, I help run Hack the North.

  Excited you found my corner of the internet!
